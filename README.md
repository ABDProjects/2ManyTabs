- **Future Features:** Plans include **ChatGPT integration** for instant AI-powered help and **customization options** for personalizing the layout, shortcuts, and overall look of your start page.

With its clean design and focus on convenience, 2ManyTabs turns your start page into a simple, powerful hub for everything you do online.
